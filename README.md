# About this branch
This branch adds 3 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
* Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Poké Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites until I'm able to get new ones for the new pockets.

To-Do:
* New bag sprites.

# Pokémon Emerald
# Pokémon Emerald Game Corner Expansion

Hello! This is a tweaked version of Chris Piche's Game Corner Expansion feature branch made by me, AGSMGMaster64.
Currently, this adds a new config file that uses some flags by default but can be configured to other flags if necessary.
Some new music and changes to the Mauville Corner have been made as well, so keep that in mind if you plan to merge this into your
existing project. Credits to AsparagusEduardo for the basis of this merge here, I just mainly tweaked things around to help
out any developers who may want to use this as well.

Updated to pokeemerald-expansion v1.11.1

To pull from this branch here, just simply use these commands here:
```
git remote add AGSMG https://github.com/agsmgmaster64/worldlinkdeluxe-ame/
git pull AGSMG gacha-expansion
```


Below is the rest of the original description from Chris Piche himself:

More specifically, this adds 4 pinball mini-games, Flappy Bird, Block Stacker, Snake, Blackjack, Voltorb Flip, Plinko, Mauville Derby, and Gacha Machines into the Game Corner.

Big thank you to huderlem (Pokemon Pinball to Emerald), and Pokeabbie (Voltorb Flip from Emerald Rogue). All I really did for these was some graphics, music, and code to work with coins. They deserve the real credits here.
Also thank you to Viperio, who made an initial Snake for Pokemon Emerald that I based my code on.
